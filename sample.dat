Disk Store function takes PID of a process, a page number and a block number as arguments. To store data into the disk, Disk Store first needs to lock the disk by invoking the Acquire Disk function of the resource manager module. After locking the disk, Disk Store updates the disk status table. Finally, Disk Store initiates the store operation for given page number and block number and waits in WAIT_DISK state until the store operation is complete. When store operation is completed, system raises the disk interrupt which makes this process READY again.
